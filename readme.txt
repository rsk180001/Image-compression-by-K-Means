Image compression using K Means algorithm.
Please install openCv for anaconda before running the program.
Steps to install opencv for anaconda can be found at https://chrisconlan.com/installing-python-opencv-3-windows/


This algorithm takes 2 command line arguments:
	1) Image to be compressed
	2) value of K
	
Output of the program is a compressed file stored in a same directory of the source code by the name "kMeansCompressed.jpg"

Keep the source image in a same folder of the program. Program runs runs 25 iterations of Kmeans and assigns mean color to pixels.

Output of the program for different values of K is available in the folder.
